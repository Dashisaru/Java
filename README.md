This repository is more or less gonna be some basic and advance code. I am hoping to add some good projects and quite possibly some actual
programs. I do please ask that anything from here that you download, if you use else where, please give me credit.
I am posting my code to get my name out there and I don't want to come across my code and I not get credit for it. Other than that, I hope
what I post can help those who need it. Also, all my Java code is done in NetBeans.
